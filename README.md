# Note

**Update**: This repository serves as an updated version of the cloned [Patreon clone](https://patreon-clone-lovat.vercel.app/) ( [github link](https://github.com/shiwam-C114/patreon-clone) ). 
The previous version encountered issues and is no longer functional. I have made improvements and fixes to provide a more reliable and feature-rich experience.

For the latest deployed version, visit [Patreon clone 2.0](https://patreon-clone-2.netlify.app).

Thank you for your understanding and continued support!
